An HR analytics dashboard is a business intelligence tool that visually displays key HR metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) like employee turnover, engagement, and recruitment statistics. It consolidates data from various systems into a single, interactive interface with charts and graphs to help HR professionals analyze workforce trends, identify areas for improvement, and support strategic decision-making.
